# Vault Hunters Better Transmog Unlocks

This mod had 3 main functions:
- changes how unknown transmogs are unlocked by applying the same logic as it is for trinkets
- adds community models into game
- adds experimental unlocks for some models.

## Community Transmogs

Community transmogs by default will be in `common` rolls. You can change their roll rarity by adding them in your desired rarity in:
`/config/the_vault/gear_model_roll_rarities.json`. Each model comes with ID that you need to use in the config file.
